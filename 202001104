# Lab-5_202001104

Github Clone Link:https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird.git

Tool Used:Pylint

Brief Overview of the project: Flappy bird game in Python


Steps I performed:

Opened Command Prompt and installed Pylint using command pip install Pylint
Navigated to the folder containing my cloned project
Ran the command py -m pylint <file_name>

I executed this for my setup.py and got this output:
************* Module setup
setup.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)
setup.py:3:0: W4901: Deprecated module 'distutils.core' (deprecated-module)
setup.py:5:0: E0401: Unable to import 'py2exe' (import-error)
setup.py:8:0: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)
setup.py:8:0: C0103: Function name "isSystemDLL" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style (invalid-name)


Interpretation:
->The module currently being used in this file is deprecated and newer more refined models are available which should have been used

->Importing module “py2exe” failed 

->Standard Naming convention for function was not observed for function “isSystemDLL”


Then I executed this for my flappy.py and got this output:
Note this was my main file so is pretty long:

Interpretation:

1)Trailing whitespaces: Misuse of storage by introducing redundant white spaces
2)Bad indentation : Proper indentation was not observed in line 391
3)Variable Name:Standard Convention of Camel-Case was not observed for almost all variables which lead to this huge error dialogue
4)Few Undefined Variables were used
5)From line 188 more branching than standard were introduced leading to messy code
6)unnecessary else in line 432 since we used return in above line so it doesn't do anything
7)Standard Function Naming convention of Snake_case was not observed for few functions

Overall quality of code was pretty poor
